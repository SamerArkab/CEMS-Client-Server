# CEMS System
CEMS is a project which my group and I worked on through the semester.
The system has many unique feutures, depending on the logged in user type - <br/>
Students can perform "online" exams, which are done using the system (including a timer, lock exam option, give extra time with certain criteria, etc.), "offline" exams which require the student to download them, view grades and more. <br/>
Teacher can create new questions, build exams, change grades, etc. <br/>
Principal can view statistics from the system's DB, approve extra time for exam, etc.

During the project I got familiar with:
- Creating UML diagrams using Visual Paradigm - Use Case Diagrams, Class Diagrams, Sequence Diagrams and Activity Diagrams.
- Implementing DB to the system (written in Java using Eclipse IDE) using MySQL.
- Client\Server systems (TCP/IP)
- Proper code documentation
- Unit testing

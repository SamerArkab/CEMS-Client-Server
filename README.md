# CEMS System
 CEMS is a project which my group and I worked on through the semester. The system has many unique features, depending on the logged in user type -<br/>
Students can perform "online" exams, which are done using the system (including a timer, lock exam option, give extra time with certain criteria, etc.), "offline" exams which require the student to download them, view grades and more.<br/>
Teachers can create new questions and exams, edit existing questions and exams, approve or change grade of students exams, etc.<br/>
Principal can view statistics from the system's DB, whether it is for a specific course or teacher, approve extra time for exam, etc. 

<br/>I got a better understanding of many related material during this project, among them:
- Creating UML diagrams using Visual Paradigm - Use-Case Diagrams, Class Diagrams, Sequence Diagrams and Activity Diagrams.
- Implementing DB to the system (written in Java using Eclipse IDE) using MySQL.
- Multithreading - used for functions related to timer.
- Client\Server (TCP\IP)
- Proper code documentation
- Unit testing
